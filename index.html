      <h2>Link Decoration</h2>

      <p>
        This is a link that points to the same tab:
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php"
          >CSS Selector Reference</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        And this one points to a different tab:
        <a
          href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php"
          target="_blank"
          >CSS Selector Reference</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        And this one points to the same tab opened by the second link:
        <a
          href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php"
          target="blank"
          >CSS Selector Reference</a

      the font-size defined for root. As stated in the `style.css` stylesheet:
      `html {font-size: 10px}`.

      <strong>very important thing to say</strong>, and something else that
      <em>should be emphasized</em> for better understanding.

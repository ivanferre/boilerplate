# Notes on HTML and CSS

## Susanne's Remarks

Use [this tool](https://validator.w3.org) to validate the HTML markup.

Start with:

1. Elements.
2. Structure.
3. Style.

Use the `<div>` tag only for styling purposes. Before you type it, always ask yourself if there is another tag that better describes the block you are going to create. And then, use it.

`<h1>` is the title of the page. It's better if there is only one per page.

**Navigation**: it's better to use an unordered list. Possibly the `<nav>` and `<a>` tags are not going to be enough to fully style the list, and the `<ul>` tag will provide an additional level for definition.

# Notes on HTML and CSS

## Susanne's Remarks

Use [this tool](https://validator.w3.org) to validate the HTML markup.

Start with:

1. Elements.
2. Structure.
3. Style.

Use the `<div>` tag only for styling purposes. Before you type it, always ask yourself if there is another tag that better describes the block you are going to create. And then, use it.

`<h1>` is the title of the page. It's better if there is only one per page.

**Navigation**: it's better to use an unordered list. Possibly the `<nav>` and `<a>` tags are not going to be enough to fully style the list, and the `<ul>` tag will provide an additional level for definition.

## Boilerplates

The word "boilerplate" means standardized pieces of text for use as clauses in contracts or as part of a computer program.

An HTML boilerplate will contain the most common elements of a page as a sample that can be cloned and used as a starting point for a project.

1. [HTML Shell](https://www.toptal.com/developers/htmlshell) has an interactive selector that lets the user build up a basic boilerplate.
2. [html5boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) is a HTML5 framework to develop webpages.
3. [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/) discusses how to architecture a website. Not only provides the boilerplate, but also explains every line of it.
